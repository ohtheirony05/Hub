**File:** [EmuWar.docx](EmuWar.docx)

At first I used CTRL + F to try and find DUCTF but to no avail. It said they tried to use AI and I thought that's a good idea. So I copied the entire document and asked ChatGPT if there was any interesting text that seemed out of place. ChatGPT found inside of ```Public Perception and Political Fallout```. At the time all the red underlines wasn't there. Another option could be to delete all the stuff you didn't see as relevent turn the docx file into a txt file and find that part.
