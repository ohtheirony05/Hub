# 🏳️ BCACTF writeups
BCACTF was the first CTF I attended this summer break and was a blast to attempt with a major spoon of frustration. I attempted it with some friends from class but due to time constraints and my dog being sick, the time I was able to spend on the CTF was limited. When attempting BCACTF 5.0 the area that proved most challenging to me was encryption which I'll need to work on going forward.

Unfortunately, when attempting BCACTF I hadn't thought about creating writeups. Only had time to properly log and document 2 of the challenges.
