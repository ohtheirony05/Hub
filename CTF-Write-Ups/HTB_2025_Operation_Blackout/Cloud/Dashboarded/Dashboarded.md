**Description:**  
After a relentless week-long effort, a lone Task Force operative successfully breached Volnaya's cloud-based ICS monitoring network, securing us permanent access to their front-end monitoring dashboard and opening a critical window into their industrial infrastructure. Your goal is to infiltrate deeper, locate sensitive data, and enable the Task Force to assume control of their core systems. IP: 3.15.107.79  
**HTB Difficulty Rating:** Very easy  
**How it felt:** WOOOH LIMITLESS PAIN!

# Steps taken
## Initial Recon:
Unfortunately, Shodan.io didn't have any information on this 3.15.107.79, but IP identified it as an Amazon AWS server. Launched community Burp Suite and browsed to 3.15.107.79 where a dashboard was presented.
